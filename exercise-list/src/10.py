# A bookstore has a nice discount policy. If you buy a $20 book today, you get a 2% discount on your next purchase. If you buy a $15 book, you get a 1.5% discount on your next purchase. That is, for each $10 you spend you get 1% discount on your next purchase. If you have to buy three books that cost $10, $20 and $30, you could buy the $30 book today, the $10 book tomorrow (on which you’ll get a 3% discount), and the $20 book the following day (on which you’ll get a 1% discount). Or you could buy the $30 book and the $20 book today, and the $10 book tomorrow (with a 5% discount). What is the cheapest way to buy five books priced at $10, $20, $30, $40 and $50?
